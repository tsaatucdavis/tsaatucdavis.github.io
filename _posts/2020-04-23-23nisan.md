Hi everyone!

<br />
Today is a very important day for us. It is the 100th anniversary of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey 🇹🇷 But there is more to it. The founder of the Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and his colleagues dedicated this day to all the children around the world because they thought that our children from every nation, race, ethnicity are in fact the future of us. They will inherit this world from us and will build a better one, thus we always celebrate this day with wonderful activities.

<br />
This year, we were planning to organize special events for the children here in Davis. Unfortunately, we cannot do it because of the restrictions. But still, we want this day to be recognized and celebrated as much as possible 😊

<br />
We wish all the children a happy April 23. We wish them all the best in their lives, and we promise to organize even a bigger event next year! We know that they are our future and our only hope.

<br />
May all the children live in a wonderful world ❤️ #ucdavis #davis #tsaatucdavis #children #california #nationalsovereigntyandchildrensday #april23rd #mustafakemalataturk🇹🇷
