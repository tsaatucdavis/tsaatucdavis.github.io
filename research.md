### Phase transitions and glass transitions
Phase transitions and glass transitions are important phenomena that we observe in almost everyday. However, the mathematics of these phenomena is not fully understood. In fact, the nature of glass transitions is listed as one of the unsolved problems in condensed matter physics. A system of hard disks is generally considered as a model for simple liquids, and it may be the simplest system that exhibits these transitions. In this project, we study the statistical topology of configuration spaces of hard disks in an effort to gain insight about phase and glass transitions. The project applies recently developed methods from the field of topological data analysis.


### Optical characterization of nano-structures
Characterization of nanometer sized structures has gained interested in various fields from nano-manufacturing to combustion systems. Recent research has been focused on non-destructive, fast and reliable techniques over conventional microscope based methods. With this regard, this project focuses on identifying the size and geometric configuration of nano-particle aggregates using numerical light scattering experiments. We have shown that the problem can be formulated as an inverse problem and solved by deterministic methods and probabilistic Bayesian statistical methods. Recently, we have introduced Gaussian processes, a supervised machine learning technique, to model more complex and complicated systems.
