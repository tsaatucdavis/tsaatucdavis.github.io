I'm a PhD student in Materials Science and Engineering at University of California, Davis. I study the statistical topology of configuration spaces in an effort to understand phase transitions; the project applies recently-developed mathematical techniques to statistical physics in order to understand a phenomenon of importance to materials science. 

<br />
Previously, I was in Prof. Erturk's group at Bogazici University, Turkey, where we studied numerical characterization of nanoparticle aggregates using Bayesian statistical approaches.

I am a mechanical engineer trying to be a materials scientist :)
